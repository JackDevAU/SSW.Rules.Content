Ever worked on a project that had many different repositories, but all needed to build and deploy the same way. i.e. build a docker file and push it. Youâ€™d have to copy and paste it all around and create a bunch of duplicated code. 

Copying and pasting the same code sucks, as a wise programmer once said, don't repeat yourself. Let's see how you can do this with GitHub's reusable workflows

<!--endintro-->



| Reusable workflows                                 | Composite actions                                                |
|:----------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Cannot call another reusable workflow              | Can be nested to have up to 10 composite actions in one workflow |
| Can use secrets                                    | Cannot use secrets                                               |
| Can use if: conditionals                           | Cannot use if: conditionals                                      |
| Can be stored as normal YAML files in your project | Requires individual folders for each composite action            |
| Can use multiple jobs                              | Cannot use multiple jobs                                         |
| Each step is logged in real-time                   | Logged as one step even if it contains multiple steps            |
